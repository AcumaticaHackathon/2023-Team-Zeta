# 2023-Team-Zeta
This is the repository for Team Zeta's Hackathon project that was held on January 28th & 29th at the 2023 Summit at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Team Zeta has created a single Dashboard in Acumatica that allows a VAR to see all the relevant details for customers in a single place.  The VAR will have the ability to add new customers by deploying the packages to each client instance.   

 

This dashboard will accrue the data from across the VAR customer base and provide a high-level view of the health of these systems.  The statistics include versions and builds for each of the configured customers, customizations counts, license usage, as well as the last financial period closed. 

 

This was accomplished by creating endpoints to access the data, custom DACs, GIs, and utilizing postman.
